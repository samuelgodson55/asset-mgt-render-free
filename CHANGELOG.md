# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here, one section per
`git tag v*.*.*` production release. Entries below the marker are inserted
automatically by [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) at
tag-push time, generated from `git log <previous-tag>..<new-tag>` (see that
workflow's `changelog` job) — the same previous-tag lookup
(`git tag --sort=-creatordate`) that [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md)'s
rollback runbook uses, so "the previous version" always means the same
thing in both places.

Don't hand-edit below the marker — your edits will be overwritten (pushed
further down, not preserved in place) the next time a tag is pushed. Notes
above the marker are yours to keep.
